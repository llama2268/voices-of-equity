Substance use is shaped by disparities in access to care, stigma, systemic bias, and socioeconomic barriers. Structural inequities affect education about substance use, the availability of treatment services, financial support for recovery, and more.

Through this initiative, our network is committed to educating, advocating, and acting in support of individuals and communities most affected.`
